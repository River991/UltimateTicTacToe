    <string name="about_text">
        This game is played just like tic tac toe with one difference, to win a tile you need to first win a smaller game within that tile.
        \n\n\
        A tie happens when there are no further moves. If a tie happens in the smaller game that tile counts as a win for both players in the bigger game.
